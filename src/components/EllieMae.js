                 <p>
                   <a href="https://elliemae.com/">Ellie Mae</a> builds software that helps automate over 1/3 of all mortages in the US.
                   Currently the company is working on creating a brand new web app version of their legacy desktop app called <a href="https://elliemae.com/about/news-reports/press-releases/ellie-mae-announces-encompass-webcenter-a-nextgeneration-web-site-for-mortgage-originators">Encompass Web</a>.

                 <h4>My Role</h4>
                 <p>
                   For the first 9 weeks of my internship I worked as a UI Engineering Intern helping build the frontend of our web app in Angular JS. I helped build a feature called task inbox
                   which notifies users of any issues with their loans. <br /><br />
                   For the last 3 weeks of my internship I worked with the UX Design team to better integrate our style guide into our frontend development teams workflow.
                   I built a web version of our sketch style guide that any developer could access.
                 </p>

                  <h1>Uber: Navigating with the Map</h1>
                  <p class="highlightedText">My friend Kevin calls me. “What are you up to right now? You should come over!”. I agree, pull out my phone, and open up the Uber app. <b>Ugh, whats his address again</b>, I thought? Ive been there a thousand times but I just can’t remember his address.</p>
                  <h3 class="galleryHeader">My Idea</h3>
                  <p>Sometimes you know where you want to go but you dont know the address. My solution to this problem was to be able to just pick a point on the map where you want to go and be able to get an Uber there.</p>
                  <h2>Problems with Current Design</h2>
                  <h3 class="galleryHeader">Usertesting</h3>
                  <p>
                        The first thing I did when takling this issue was run usertests on the current app. Usertesting alows you to get a sense of what user’s insticts are and what they intuitivley want to do when presented with a task.
                        <br><br>
                        All I did was ask users the following prompt:<br>
                        “Suppose you forgot the address to your own house. Try to navigate there using Uber.”
                        <br><br>
                        I usertested 5 people and here is what they did:<br>
                        - Only 1 person was able to find the current way to do this<br>
                        - 4 out of the 5 people's first instict was to tap on the map<br>
                        - Those 4 people's second instict was to dig through the menu system.

                  </p>

                              <h3 class="galleryHeader">Discoverability</h3>
                              <p>
                                    Going into this redesign I was under the impression that you couldn’t uber to a point on the map. This is because the current method to do this is super hidden. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    First you click the search bar, then you are provided with a normal looking search page. You are supposed to drag down to reveal a map where you can then place a pin for your destination. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    During usertesting no one was able to find this feature.
                              </p>
                              <h3 class="galleryHeader">Too Many Steps</h3>
                              <p>
                                    The other main issue with the current approach was how many steps it took to do this simple task. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Assuming the user knows how to use this feature it would take a click, a swipe down, a drag, and then another click just to pick a spot on the map.

                  <h2>Designing a New Interaction</h2>
                  <p>Through usertesting, I realized that a most people’s instict was to just try clicking a spot on the map to navigate there. This made a ton of sense to me and became the premise of my redesign.</p>
                  <h3 class="galleryHeader">Step 1: “Wireframe” basic flow</h3>
                  <p>Normally I would NEVER wireframe the entire flow this early. However, after usertesting, this basic flow felt very obvious and there was no point in putting this off.</p>
                  <img src='images/uber/uberFlowDiagram.png'>
                  <h3 class="galleryHeader">Step 2: Explore Options</h3>
                  <p>Because I didnt want to redesign the entire app, most of the design work happened on the second screen. I created a bunch of low fidelity mocks and analyzed the pros and cons of each. These were the designs that stood out:</p>

            </div>

            <div class="sectionContent">
                  <p>I ended up picking option 3 for a couple reasons. The main reason was that it was able to hide all the elements that didnt serve a purpose when you are scrolling around the map. It kept the question of “Where to?” on the screen and it kept the advertising card while hiding everything else.</p>
                  <h3 class="galleryHeader">Step 3: High-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
                  <p>The next step was just to recreate the Uber app in sketch. I remade all the UI elements from scratch and designed all the screens. This step was all about getting the details right.</p>
                  <h3 class="galleryHeader">Step 4: Create Interactive Prototype with Principle</h3>
                  <p>Finally I used principle to create the final prototype. Here is the final product:</p>

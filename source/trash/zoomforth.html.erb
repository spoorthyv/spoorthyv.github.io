                  <h4>My Role</h4>
                  <p>
                        As a designer at Zoomforth I had two main duties. My main job was to fix UI/UX issues with the web application.<br><br>

                        My other job was to work with companies to help them design their Zoomforth pages.
                        If a customer ever had issues with their page, needed design advice, or just needed to build a new page from scratch I was always on call to help them.

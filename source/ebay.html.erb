                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p> 
                        Last Summer I worked as a UX Design Intern for eBay’s Design Sytems team. Traditionally eBay has not had a cohesive design language. Our team was responsible for creating a fully components based Design System and, in the process, a fresh new design language. I created 2 different patterns for this team: Empty States and Filtering for mobile devices.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Filtering on Mobile Devices</h2>
                  <p> 
                        With this project I had to create a pattern for filtering a list of items/results on mobile devices. I needed to create logic and consistency across all our different pages. After that it was up to me to decide what to prioritize and what to change.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Step 1A: Internal Research</h3>
                  <p>
                        I spent a little over a week combing through both of ebay’s mobile apps and the mobile website, collecting screenshots, and talking to designers in every design team that I could think of that may get effected/benefit from my work on the filtering pattern. I came out of the internal research with 2 goals: increase consistency and usage of filters.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Step 1B: External Research</h3>
                  <p>
                        The next thing I did was analyze what other companies were doing with their mobile filtering UIs. My goal here was to understand what scenarios their filter patterns were used in, which tradeoffs they made, and why they made those tradeoffs. Basically, I wanted to figure out every option that I might need to consider in my own designs.
                        </br></br>
                        First I weighed the pros and cons of every type of filtering UI that I saw in my external research and tried to understand how they would affect our 2 main goals. I decided that a pill-based filtering UI would be the way to go.
                        </br></br>
                        From there I broke down the pill filtering into specific design parts: placement, secondary buttons, highlighted filters, bottom overlay content style, and bottom overlay pill bar style. For each category I tried to come up with as many options as I could.     
                  </p>

                  <h3>Step 2: Design Exploration</h3>
                  <p>
                        This step is where creativity comes in (methodical creativity). My goal here is to make sure that I’ve considered every possible option that makes any sort of sense. 
                        </br></br>
                        I gathered screenshots from 20 different company’s mobile apps and mobile websites and analyzed their filtering mechanisms in browse pages and search pages. It took me 3-4 days to go through over 350 screenshots and distill down my thoughts into a couple different findings. I presented my research to a couple different stakeholders using the slide deck below:
                  </p>
                  <h3>Step 3: Consolidation and Communication</h3>
                  <p>
                        Now I distilled all my wild options, into a few of the best options for each part of the UI. I tried to compile a list of pros and cons for each of these options and get really specific with my analysis. After getting feedback from my team and tweaking my analysis, I again went around to designers from different stakeholder teams across eBay to get their opinion on things. This is the point where I made it a point to get a lot of feedback from the accessibilty team and developers on feasability and engineering constraints. 
                  </p>
                  <h3>Step 4: Interaction Design and Visual Details</h3>
                  <p>
                        The last step before wrapping my pattern up was to iron out the little details. With this pattern I really wanted to make sure the iteraction of opening up the bottom container made sense and felt natural. I also made it a point to finalize all the colors and icons.

                              <p>At the end of this internship I provided sketch assets for every part of this pattern that other designers could use and detailed documentation on when and how to use this pattern.</p>

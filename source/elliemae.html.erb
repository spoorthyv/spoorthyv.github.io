                  <h4>My Role</h4>
                  <p> 
                        For the first 9 weeks of my internship I worked as a UI Engineering Intern helping build the frontend of our web app in Angular JS. I helped build a feature called task inbox 
                        which notifies users of any issues with their loans. <br><br>

                        For the last 3 weeks of my internship I worked with the UX Design team to better integrate our style guide into our frontend development teams workflow. 
                        I built a web version of our sketch style guide that any developer could access.
